  <section class="post-content"><p>My name is Ilche, an innovative DevOps engineer with a diverse work history and educational background. Professional experience of 9 years as a Systems Administrator, Developer and DevOps Engineer. The knowledge of system administration, writing automation tools and deployment workflows allows me to bridge the gap between development and operations for an efficient work model.</p>

<p>My college education was responsible for introducing me to the basics of different programming languages such as C, C++ and Python. Approaching the Cisco Network Academy was my first step in to the networking labs. The first time when I configured my own CentOS machine with different types of exercises for configuring network interfaces, firewall, static and dynamic routes etc I found a lot of similarities between the Cisco routers and switches configurations in Command Line Interface and services configurations in the Linux command line. Those similarities were really important for me for learning complex things on the Linux platform, and I am thankful to my first command line skills.</p>

<p>But that was before several years, now I am a DevOps Engineer/Cloud Architect and I am working as a maintainer and architect of a different clusters based on Kubernetes, Docker Swarm and OpenShift, I have experience with preparing multi-tenant clusters on a Linux machines by deploying the cluster parts using Ansible and Terraform. I have experience in projects for migrating services from OpenShift to Kubernetes on GCP and also organizing the workflow of the process of that kind of projects. Writing Helm charts and deploying them automatically to Kubernetes over Spinnaker is the most common combination during my working hours.</p>

<p>Now I am an experienced Engineer, I am up to date with the newest technologies for developing high availability cloud platforms, with every new project and task I am collecting experience more and more especially when I am working for large companies and organizations. In the past, Iâ€™ve been involved in projects for IKEA, Open Knowledge Foundation, UNHCR, DataGov US and many others. I can describe myself as a really organized and calm engineer with a depth technical knowledge and skills for always improving the flow of the processes and make them be automated as much as they can be. I am always looking forward to improving my knowledge and learn new facts and technologies.</p>

<p>In my free time, I am working on a personal project for tracking orders from eCommerce platforms, actually, those are several applications responsible for the orders management. The project is still under development but I am happy to share my Python Flask Backend application <a href="https://github.com/ordertracker/api">Api</a>.</p>

<p>The desire to grow and develop more and more has led me to be a member of one of the largest open source communities in the world, I am volunteering in <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io">k8s.io</a>.</p>
